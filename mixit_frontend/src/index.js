// persistConfig is used to define the

// storage: The engine we will use for persistence.
// It can also be used to define the blacklist or whitelist, which are lists of reducers to omit/include for persistence
//Other things it can define include stateReconciler, which tells Redux the way state should be merged upon rehydration

// HOW PERSISTING STORE ACTUALLY WORKS

// When your app launches, redux sets an initial state. 
// Shortly after this, Redux Persist retrieves your persisted state from storage. 
// Your persisted state then overrides any initial state.
